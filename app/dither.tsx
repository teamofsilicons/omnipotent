/**
 * An ordered-dither field, used once per page and never twice.
 *
 * A smooth gradient is quantised to two tones through an 8x8 Bayer matrix, so
 * the falloff is carried by the density of dots rather than by opacity. It is
 * drawn at one device pixel per cell and scaled up with `image-rendering:
 * pixelated`, which is what keeps the dots crisp and the canvas tiny — a
 * 200x120 buffer covers a full-width hero.
 *
 * It sits behind content at low opacity and is skipped entirely on small
 * screens and for anyone who has asked for less motion.
