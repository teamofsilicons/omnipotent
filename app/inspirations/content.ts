/**
 * Where this came from.
 *
 * Design is not only how a thing looks. It is how it feels, how it is
 * understood, how it travels, how it is used over time, what idea it carries,
 * how it reads, how it is laid out, how it moves and how it answers to a hand.
 * Ten headings, then, and six or seven debts under each. The page counts them
 * itself rather than printing a number that can rot.
 *
 * Every entry was checked. `mechanic` is what the thing actually does, stated
 * concretely enough to argue with. `taken` is what we did about it — and that
 * half is ours, so if a connection seems far-fetched, it is, and it was still
 * the reason.
