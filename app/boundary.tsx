/**
 * The turn boundary.
 *
 * Two things arrive while a turn is running, and omni treats them as opposites
 * on purpose. A message is injected — it lands inside the turn, because that is
 * what you meant by sending it now. A change of model is held — it lands at the
 * seam, because a model changing underneath itself halfway through a tool call
 * is not a feature, it is a bug with a marketing name.
 *
 * Both are recorded the moment you ask. Only one is applied then.
