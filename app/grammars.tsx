/**
 * Three grammars, one gauge.
 *
 * The tracks are drawn at three different tie spacings on purpose. Every
 * vendor ships a good CLI and no two of them speak the same way — one takes
 * flags and JSON lines on stdin, one takes JSON-RPC over a socket, one takes
 * neither and has to be handed its history inside the next message. It is a
 * break of gauge, and the only honest way to draw it is to draw it as one.
