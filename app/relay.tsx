/**
 * One thread, three vendors, and an answer that shows its sources.
 *
 * This was four bordered cards stacked up, each with its own coloured rail, and
 * the borders between them cut the rail into four — so the picture said "four
 * separate exchanges" while the paragraph above it said "one conversation."
 *
 * Now the rail is continuous. Each leg's segment butts against the next, so the
 * line runs unbroken from the first message to the last and simply changes
 * colour where the vendor changes. A dot on the rail marks each handoff.
 *
 * The payoff is the last line. Claude is asked to list all three facts, and the
 * three it returns are printed in the colours of the three companies that were
 * told them — so the answer carries its own provenance, and you can see at a
 * glance that two thirds of it came out of somebody else's model.
